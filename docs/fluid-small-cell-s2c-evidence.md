# S2c small Cut-cell pressure pooling — CI evidence and next gate

Observed on PR #326 commit `c260625f8e74b5eb6c296ac9686d5d63f2fd3b57`, workflow [43268224810](https://github.com/buddas-bible/zonai/actions/runs/43268224810), Windows Release job. Ubuntu and Windows jobs completed successfully. **Research only: do not enable the model by default or merge as a validated physical fix.**

## Frozen-state threshold sweep

CSV source: `sandboxWindStepBenchmark --small-cell-merge-threshold-audit`. Same pre-projection state, V(17,13), h=0.25 m, World 8 / Fluid 4, two-way ON and Drag 0. Threshold is the opt-in minimum fluid fraction.

All six sweep rows reported PCG status 1. The reduced operator enforces *group* continuity. It explicitly does not enforce the same pointwise continuity in a sliver: the increase in individual continuity is material and cannot be presented as an individual-cell improvement. Conserved global tracer mass is not proof of acceptable local tracer transport. Virtual internal exchange and geometry displacement require independent interpretation.

## Continuous World comparison

The `--small-cell-world-feedback-audit` run tested two separately evolved trajectories at fixed parameters, not a common frozen snapshot. Drag=0 reported last merged frame 15 and sum of merged cells over last substeps 2; Drag=3 reported last merged frame 21 and sum 3. Different trajectories must not be interpreted as a paired same-state face-speed correction. The output has columns for pressure force/torque, Body position/speed, continuity, pressure impulse, and PCG status, so acceptance requires explicit divergence curves and tolerance definitions rather than a simple pass flag.

## Tracer and geometry diagnostic

The `--small-cell-local-tracer-audit` tracer-seeded experiment returned global mass 0.00731756771 kg in the printed frame-5 and frame-19 cases. In the swept-remap frame-5 baseline, unresolved tracer was 1.44328651e-5 kg with 2 unresolved sources; the worst source at (18,13) retained ~1.44238064e-5 kg without a usable outward swept transfer although its neighboring final faces were open. This is a **local redistribution diagnostic**, not proof of lost global mass. In the swept-remap frame-19 baseline unresolved mass rose to 6.81927268e-5 kg with 3 sources; the worst cell (18,13) had geometry-displaced mass 6.6337292e-5 kg, swept transfer 6.23862805e-6 kg, and later MAC net outward transport 6.95686689e-5 kg. Swept remap, tracer transport and endpoint geometry flux are distinct stages; adding their totals blindly would double-count.

## Required next atomic work

1. Add a **read-only per-stage local tracer/volume closure test** for the same source cell and its connected neighbors, including negative inward and outward swept-face signs. Assert that each stage's mass ledger balances separately: previous mass, swept transfer, fallback, unresolved retained/trapped mass, MAC flux and final mass. Never declare unresolved tracer automatically lost.
2. Compare `snapshot_delta_m3`, `pressure_source_delta_m3`, `swept_divergence_m3`, and `mac_endpoint_out_m3` at matching captured geometry, distinguishing endpoint area flux from swept-volume transfer.
3. Require opening/closing, reopened face, fully disconnected cell, all four directions, varying h and World/Fluid cadence. Record baseline and pooled group continuity **and** individual continuity, local tracer displacement, pressure force/torque, body trajectory and runtime.
4. No forced velocity/pressure clamp, no default threshold change, no merging #322 sampling into this experiment. Retain #326 as Draft until conservation and dynamic feedback acceptance is justified.

This note records evidence and a bounded test target; it does not claim to have implemented or rerun the test suite beyond CI 43268224810.
